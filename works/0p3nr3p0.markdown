0P3NR3P0

The GLI.TC/H 0P3NR3P0 is an open/public repository of glitch art worx. It's a modular art&&archive project serving multiple goals

- it's been developed as an open port for anyone anywhere to submit glitch art worx (that can be represented by a URL: i.e. video, images, sound, web) 
- initially the 0P3NR3P0 served as a remote submission system for the 2112 GLI.TC/H festival/conference/gathering in Chicago. 
- at present the 0P3NR3P0's archives are undergoing some maintenence, but in the future it will be perpetually open for submissions && perpetually available for curators intersted in exhibiting glitch worx from the archive.
